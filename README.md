# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-Hybrid-Model

This research investigates the application of a hybrid model, combining Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to enhance the detection of lung cancer 
using deep learning methodologies. Focusing on the analysis of CT scans and X-rays, this study 
endeavors to refine the accuracy and efficacy of lung cancer identification by amalgamating the 
strengths of both CNNs and SVMs.

The proposed hybrid model begins with CNNs for feature extraction, allowing for the discernment 
of intricate patterns within lung images. These extracted features serve as inputs to SVM classifiers, 
enabling precise classification between cancerous and non-cancerous nodules.

Through meticulous experimentation and model optimization, this study showcases the synergistic 
potential of CNNs and SVMs in lung cancer detection. The hybrid model exhibits heightened 
sensitivity and specificity, achieving superior accuracy in identifying and classifying potential 
malignancies within lung imaging datasets.

The outcomes underscore the significant advancements made possible by integrating CNNs and 
SVMs, presenting a promising avenue for more effective and precise early detection of lung cancer. 
This research contributes to the evolving landscape of AI-driven healthcare by offering a robust 
framework poised to revolutionize lung cancer diagnosis and subsequent patient care.
